### Hi there, I'm Sagar Vadnere. ðŸ‘‹
A Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience specializing in web development, JavaScript, and React.

I write code to build scalable, robust, and secure websites. I also like to solve production bugs with high severity. Recently, I have been helping clients to fix technical SEO issues to improve page speed insights scores and overall website performance.

I write scripts in Python to automate any manual work for me or my colleagues. I have also had some experience in hardening web servers and penetration testing for websites. I have always been an enthusiast for Cyber Security, and Open Source technologies. 

I am always passionate about giving more to the community, and sharing knowledge has always motivated me. I am curious about how technology is changing the world.
