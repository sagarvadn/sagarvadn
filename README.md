### Hi there, I'm Sagar Vadnere. 👋
I specialize in building intelligent AI agents using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Next.js, creating dynamic and agentic flows that offer personalized, interactive experiences. With over 8.6 years of experience as a Web Developer, I also have strong expertise in JavaScript, React, and Next.js, crafting high-performance, user-centric web applications.

I stay at the forefront of the latest trends in both AI and front-end development, ensuring I create sleek, responsive, and efficient interfaces. Proficient in Git, HTML, and CSS, I bring a well-rounded approach to development, ensuring code quality and adherence to industry standards.

In addition to AI and front-end development, my expertise extends to full-stack applications, where I seamlessly integrate React, Next.js, Node.js, Supabase, and MongoDB. I actively participate in code reviews, offering constructive feedback that fosters collaboration and continuous improvement.

My passion for optimizing website performance, coupled with my experience in building AI-driven solutions, drives me to deliver innovative, cutting-edge web applications.

Let’s connect and explore how we can collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of web and AI technologies.
